CIFpy3
===================

CIFpy3 is a python rewrite and adaptation of the [Collective Intelligence Framework](http://csirtgadgets.org/collective-intelligence-framework/). The python version has a number of significant performance and feature advantages over the long standing Perl version.

There are two main components: the server, and the client. The server is responsible for almost everything. The client is simply used to interact and format data using the fully RESTful API exposed by the server.

Features
----------
* Powered by Python 3.4+
* Performance
  * Ingest ~50-60 Observables per second per CPU core
    * This equates to ingesting about 800K Observables in ~35 minutes using 8vCPUs
  * Less than 250MB RAM per worker process
  * Configurable workers/threads count
    * Default: (1 Worker per CPU + 30 threads per /worker)
  * Faster Installation (only a few dependencies)
* Features
  * Completely Modular
    * Can split Front-End API / Feed Parser / Workers from each other
    * Run multiple worker servers if desired
  * Uses RabbitMQ for queue management
  * Full REST API
  * Simple Architecture
  * Easy to read logs
  * Comprehensive documentation and code commenting
  * Cross platform compatible
  * More flexable scheduling using hourly, daily, or weekly intervals specified for each feed
* Bug Fixes
  * No longer bails out if a single feed fails
  * Handles errors better
  * Doesn't consume memory unchecked for large feeds
  * Logic bug fixes
  * Reduction in number of memory leaks (zero or near zero leaks)
  * Proper proxy usage when fetching feeds

Architecture
---------------

#### Definitions
* **observable**: A piece of unique information used to identify an item of interest (ip, domain name, hash)
* **feed**: A source containing observables to be imported
* **parser**: Parsers are responsible for parsing types of feeds (csv, rss, etc) and converting them to objects.
* **feeder**: Process that is in charge of retrieving feeds and parsing them.
* **worker**: Process used to ingest an observable, augment it with meta, and context.
* **worker plugin**: Plugins will create *new* observables related to the ingested one for purpose of context
* **worker meta**: Worker Meta adds information about an ingested observable (GeoIP, rDNS, etc)
* **rest api**: The CIF Rest API is available on HTTP port 8080.  
* **storage engine**: The final resting place for any observables created. (Elasticsearch)
* **cif-server**: The controlling daemon that runs and manages the workers, feeder, and REST API.

#### Logic
The lifecycle of an observable

1. Feed is downloaded from source using the 'feeder'.
2. Feed is then parsed using a 'parser'.
3. Parser sends the observable to a queue to be worked. 
4. Worker picks up the observable from the queue.
5. Worker first adds meta to the observable by running worker meta scripts against it
6. Worker then runs plugins against the now augmented observable. 
7. Worker then adds meta to any new observables created from the plugins
8. Worker sends observables to storage engine
9. Observable can now be searched using the rest api
10. Observable will be removed once it has not been seen for X number of days (default: 14)

Prerequisites
-------------
* A powerful and fast upstream DNS server (use a local caching instance is preferred).
  * This software can generate over 3000 DNS requests/second second when using 8 vCPUs and is processing lots of observables
* One of the following supported operating systems
  * Debian 8 (jessie) or later
  * Ubuntu 14.04 (trusty) or later
  * CentOS 7 or later
  * RHEL 7 or later (with an active RHN subscription)
  * FreeBSD 10.2 or later

Installation
-------------
By default CIFpy3 gets installed to /usr/local/cifpy3/.

> **note**: be sure to save the admin token generated during installation. You need it if you want to add any additional users or use CIFpy3 with authentication enabled or even use the API. It does get saved to ~/.cif.

RedHat/CentOS
```
#!/bin/bash
curl -k https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmdevince/cifpy3/master/bin/install.sh > install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Ubuntu/Debian
```
#!/bin/bash
wget --no-check-certificate -O install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmdevince/cifpy3/master/bin/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

CIFpy3 will automatically install and configure a token for the cli & user that installs CIFpy3. This is the admin token. Any token flagged as an 'admin' is capable of deleting other admins.


Updating
--------
Very simple process to update cifpy3

```
#!/bin/bash
cd /usr/local/cifpy3
git pull
```

Then reboot your server or just restart the cif-server service.

Usage
-------
#### Configuring & Running
* Directory Layout
  * bin: Runtime files (cif, cif-server, cif-utility, install.sh)
  * cache: Cache folder for feed journals
  * etc: Contains configuration files for CIFpy3
    * feeds: This is where all feeds go. Standard YAML format is used. Feeds outside of this directory (or in subdirectories) are not loaded
  * lib: Contains the CIF runtime and GeoIP database if downloaded
  * log: Contains log files for CIFpy3 runs

#### CLI Usage
CIFpy3 comes with a CLI client called 'cif'. This client can be used to manage an entire CIF instance easily.


* Features
  * Select only fields desired. Almost any field is searchable
  * Customize output formats (csv,pipe,xml,json,delimiter)
  * Shows HTTP requests sent and received for debugging and advanced API usage

More details are available via the --help argument(> cif --help)

#### API Usage

The REST API by default is available on port 8080. It is very simple to use and returns JSON payloads for requests that return objects.

Objects are created or modified using POST parameters. For a full list of parameters and their meanings please see the object reference guide below.

> **note**: The CLI utility can generate and show the HTTP request sent if additional examples are needed


#### Example Observable Search Request
To search for an observable named 'google.com' and tagged with whitelist use the following example
```
GET /observables?observable=google.com&tags=whitelist&provider=alexa.com
Authorization: <insert token here>
```

#### Example Observable Submission
Creates an observable of 'google.com' with a provider of alexa.com and a tag of whitelist
```
PUT /observables
Authorization: <insert token here>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

observable=google.com&provider=alexa.com&tags=whitelist
```



Object Reference
----------------
Bold items are required. Italicised are only required when modifying objects.

Most of these are automatically filled in using Worker meta and plugins after the observable is submitted.

#### Observable
* *id*: Unique 64 byte hex ID (optional for new objects)
* lang: Two character language type (optional)
* group: One or more groups the observable can belong to, default: everyone (optional)
* tlp: Traffic Light Protocol attribute. Can be one of 'white', 'green', 'yellow', 'red'.
* confidence: An integer or float of the observables confidence level. Higher is more confident.
* tags: List of tags to group like observables together. (Example: whitelist)
* description: A description of this observable or why it is listed
* data: Original Purpose Unknown
* otype: Observable type, valid values are ipv4,ipv6,url,fdqn,email,hash,binary.
* **observable**: The observable string or path to binary. If set before otype, otype will be automatically detected
* application: The application that utilizes this obserable
* provider: The domain name or name of the list providing the observalbe
* reporttime: The time the observable was reported. Most standard formats are acceptable.
* firsttime: The time the observable was first seen. Most standard formats are acceptable.
* lasttime: The time the observable was last seen. Most standard formats are acceptable.
* adata: ??
* related: A 'parent' or related observable ID
* altid: Alternate ID or link to more details about the observable.
* altid_tlp: Traffic Light Protocol of the TLP. May be different from the observable TLP
* additional_data: Original Purpose Unknown. Likely a place for any additional data that doesn't fit anywhere else.
* Other non-standard object attributes can be created and stored by simply creating the observable with them (e.g. rank)

Performance Notes
------------------
This is running with 8x workers and 30x threads. ~ 850-900 observables per second being augmented / correlated.

This is while processing the largest feed in the CIF feed list. DGA list by Bambenek Consulting

Only 1.25GB of memory in use by applications (half of that being used by elasticsearch).
